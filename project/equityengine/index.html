      <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
        EquityEngine is a multi-phase research initiative aimed at enhancing the educational experience
        for engineering students, particularly those with attention disorders such as Attention-Deficit/
        Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), in post-secondary education. By leveraging the transformative
        potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and adopting a participatory design approach, this
        research focuses on developing a multifunctional AI-driven platform that provide tailored
        support and enhances focus, motivation, self-agency, and educational outcomes for engineering students.

        <p>
          Three core pillars of our research: Accessibility, Engineering Education, and Artificial
          ntelligence. By intersecting these areas, we aim to create a more inclusive and engaging
          learning environment for college students in engineering programs, and more broadly, across
          STEM disciplines.. The overlapping region represents the synergy where all three pillars
          converge, driving the development of tailored, AI-driven solutions that enhance both educational
          outcomes and mental-welling.

            Existing literatures reveals a pronounced scarcity of AI-driven learning tools developed specifically
            \for post-secondary STEM education. The majority of existing tools are designed primarily for K-12
            students, overlooking the distinct, more advanced challenges faced by SLWD in higher education.

      <h3 class="title">Targeted Population</h3>
      <p>
        ADHD is the most common condition associated with attention disorders, affecting 21.8% of the
        SLWD population and up to 13.8% of college students reported in Spring 2024. In addition,
        students with major depressive disorder also face substantial concentration challenges.
        Besides those with formal diagnoses, maintaining focus and motivation has been a common
        challenge among post-secondary engineering students.

      <h3 class="title">Methodology</h3>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h3 class="title">Proposed Solution</h3>
      <img src="/img/psdow_ee.png" alt="TBD">
      <p>
        Three-dimensional real-time data will be measured to guide our Adaptive Intervention Module:
      </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.5;">
          <li>
            Physiological Signals (e.g., heart-rate, eye-tracking);
          </li>
          <li>
            Behavioral Signals (e.g., click frequency, tab-switching, facial expression);
          </li>
          <li>
            Contextual Signals (e.g., assignment difficulty, pop-up responses).
          </li>
        </ul>
       <p>
        Based on these real-time measures, the system will generate an Engagement Index. This index is
        then fed into a tiered decision logic that determines the interventions (e.g., micro-prompts,
        task adjustment, contextual re-engagement).
      </p>

      <!--<h3 class="title">Key Milestones</h3>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.5;">
        <li>
          Phase 1: Literature Review: Identify existing research gaps, particularly in AI-driven tools
          for post-secondary STEM education for SLWD. This phase focuses on understanding the current
          landscape and pinpointing the areas most lacking in support and technology.
        </li>
        <li>Phase 2: Mixed-Method User Studies
          <ul>
            <li>
              Surveys: Conduct comprehensive surveys to gather data on demographics, learning styles,
              environmental factors, and experiences with existing AI-powered tools among the general
              student body.
            </li>
            <li>
              Semi-structured Interviews: Dive deeper into SLWD’s learning experiences, both traditional
              and technologically enhanced, to grasp the potential and current effectiveness of AI-driven
              tools. This phase also explores DEI aspects within AI education environments.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Phase 3: Data analysis: Analyze the qualitative data from the semi-structured interviews and
          quantitative data from the survey to establish design principles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Phase 4: Prototype Development: Create initial digital mockups of the AI-driven platform
          based on data-driven design principles and develop a functional prototype incorporating
          feedback with inspection-based testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Phase 5: Usability Testing and Iterative Design: Conduct extensive usability testing with
          SLWD to refine and adjust the platform. This iterative process ensures the tool is responsive
          to user needs and accessible in various learning environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Phase 6: Outcome Consolidation: Consolidate outcomes and publish findings.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="title">Archive Prototype</h3>
      <img src="/img/arch-chat.png" alt="TBD">
      <p>
        The technical objectives of the archive prototype were centered around effectively implementing
        the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, a sophisticated framework designed to
        enhance the chatbot's responsiveness and accuracy in providing user-specific information sourced
        from university websites.

          LangChain's OpenAIEmbeddings was used to convert preprocessed text into high-dimensional vectors
          that capture semantic context, ensuring accurate and relevant chatbot responses. For efficient
          storage and retrieval, the team evaluated robust vector stores like FAISS and Pinecone. Factors
          such as deployment ease and integration capabilities will guide our selection, optimizing the
          chatbot's ability to provide timely and precise assistance.
        </li>
        <li>
          The retrieval-based chatbot was built with LangChain's RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain, utilizing
          vector similarity for accurate, context-aware answers. The user interface is developed
          using Streamlit to ensure smooth and intuitive interactions, enhancing real-time responsiveness.
